# quickwebprint
ðŸš§ **This project is still a work in progress.** ðŸš§
Seamless printing from any device with a simple web interface, no apps or drivers required.

This project provides a mobile-first web interface for printers, eliminating the need for apps or additional drivers on the end-user's device.

**Why not IPP?** Although IPP is supported on Android, it still requires apps like Mopria to be installed.

**Why not AirPrint?** While AirPrint offers driverless printing on Apple devices, it requires additional packages and services to be configured on the printer server.

Note: A printer server, specifically CUPS, must be configured for this setup, and vendor-specific drivers must still be installed on the same server.
